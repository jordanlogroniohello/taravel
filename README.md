## Explanation on why your UI and UX implementation and code implementation is the best.

About on UI and UX I use this layout because its very plain and simple it helps user to read the content easily by just scrolling down the page. I use dropdown menu to the locations of japan so that user can easily choose what place they want to check, I know that the site that I made need more improvement thats why i made some recomendations. 

recommendation:
- maps on every destination and pin and every venues availaible
- search bar for dynamic search.

and about on coding, i would say my code is the best because i implement all the instruction and the coding guidlines.
